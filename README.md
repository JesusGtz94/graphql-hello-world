# GraphQL Hello World

Hello everyone this is my first GraphQL approach. It is an example of the simplest way to create communication between a web client and a server through GraphQl.

## How to run it

To run it, you just need to open the file **_client/index.html_** in any web browser.

Then, go to the **_server/_** directory, run **npm install**, and then execute **node server.js**. The server should start running.

The **Loading...** text in the web browser should be replaced with **Hello world**. That message comes from the server, so you can modify it by changing line 12 in the **_server/server.js_** file.

## Dependencies

- node
- npm
- @apollo/server
- graphql
